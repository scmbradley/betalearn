# BetaLearn

BetaLearn is a small python project to produce figures and simulations for a paper I am working on.
The project consists of: 

 - `betalearn.py`: This is where all the magic happens
 - `creategraphs.py`: This script actually produces the graphics
 
The project uses `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`.
